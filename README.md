# Architype
A calculator, Pythagorean theorem finder, height converter, and temp converter ALL IN ONE!

LIMITATIONS OF THE PROGRAM:
Pythagorean Theorem finder is only a command line interface, kinda like the first phase of development. 

If you see this, thank you sir for making me explore the fun of coding. I may not show much enthusiasm, but coding the final parts of the project was so fun.

I'd like to thank my friend, Eddie, for setting up the GitHub for me. I'm fairly new to Git and it looks fun so why not?
